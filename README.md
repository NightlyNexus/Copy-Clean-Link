Copy Clean Link
=====================

Copy clean (and AMP-resolved) links on Android. Remove tracking query parameters and other unnecessary ugliness from your links.

The link cleaning follows [Braveâ€™s implementation](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/653cbb7f1d96092307f630d3fc9e2f64985c5570/brave-lists/clean-urls.json), resolves the AMP link if the link is an AMP link, and copies the resulting clean link to your Android clipboard.
